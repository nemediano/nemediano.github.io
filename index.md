Hello, I am Jorge Antonio García Galicia (a.k.a nemediano).
I currently work at [Google](https://about.google/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} as a Software Engineer.
I studied my doctorate at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, but I consider [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} my alma mater.

My professional interests are divided into two: as a mathematician I like Geometry (analytic, modern, computational, algebraic), and as a computer scientist I love Computer Graphics.
My [Erdos number]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/pdf/ErdosNumber.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} is four.

Even though my professional training is technical and scientific, I come from a family of artists which contributed to developing a great appreciation for the arts and humanities.

On a more personal note, I'm a real geek. I enjoy: reading comics (especially non-superhero ones), novels, mathematics, art, video games, television series, sports, music and cartoons.

I was born and raised in Mexico city, but now I live with my wife and our two cats in Silicon valley.
