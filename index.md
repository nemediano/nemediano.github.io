Hi, I am Jorge Antonio García Galicia (a.k.a nemediano). This is my personal site where you can find stuff about me, like my projects, resume and publications.
My professional interests are twofold: as a mathematician I like Geometry (analytic, modern computational, algebraic), and as a computer scientist I love Computer Graphics.

I have a PhD from Purdue University, but I consider UNAM as my alma mater. Currently, I work at Google as a Software Engineer. My [Erdos number]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/pdf/ErdosNumber.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} is four.

Even Though my professional background is technical, I come from a family of artists which contributed to my development of a great appreciation for art and the humanities.

More personally, I am a geek in all the good senses. I enjoy comics (specially, non-superhero ones), novels, math, art, video games, tv shows, sports, music and cartoons.
I was born and raised in Mexico city, but now I live with my wife and our two cats in Silicon valley.
