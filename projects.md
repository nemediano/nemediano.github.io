This is a non comprehensive list of my personal projects. Most of them are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/nemediano){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

### My personal homage to Robert E. Howard

I have been a [Robert E. Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Howard){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} fan since I was a child. In the last few years, I found out that there are a lot of resources in English compared to the ones in Spanish.
With that in mind, I decided to start a [youtube channel](){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} about him.
Then, I realized that I needed [a blog](https://nemediano.github.io/canalREH/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} as a companion (so I can share content and links) and use it as an excuse to learn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. As usual, I keep it all in a [repository](https://github.com/nemediano/canalREH){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

### Templates for learning OpenGL

While I gave a [Computer Graphics course](https://www.acatlan.unam.mx/files/PlanesDeEstudio/MAC/7/Graficacion_por_Computadora.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} at [FESA](https://www.acatlan.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (and later at Purdue as a TA), I found out that most students struggle to follow the programming assignments. I realized that, in part, this is due to the large number of required pieces that are needed in an [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} program, but they are independent from the main graphic task. For example:

* Loading model (that can include more than one mesh) data from a file.
* Routines to write and read images to and from a file. To read texture data and save screenshoots.
* Read and compile/debug a shader program from a text file.
* Create a simple UI, where you can change parameters from various types (scalars, vectors, colors or orientations).
* To do simple interaction with the program: respond to keyboard and mouse events.
* Interact with the windows manager system: have a surface to render, create a view port, go into full screen mode.

Just to name a few. Having that in mind, I decided to create [a set of templates](https://github.com/nemediano/OpenGLTemplates){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} to alleviate this work.

### LaTeX templates for academic use (UNAM focused)

During my life at the Academia, I used [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} to create several types of documents. Since I am no expert in LaTeX, I decided to create [a set of templates](https://github.com/nemediano/latexPlantillaUnam){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. I believe they have 20% LaTeX which you use 80% of the time. The templates are divided by use case, and they are already localized to use them in Spanish. They use UNAM’s logos, and colors, but they can be adapted with minimal modifications to be used for any education institution.

## Talks

These are some of the events where they have invited me to talk. The actual talks are in Spanish.

## Touring with Pixels

This is a “my journey” presentation, about me. I detail how the early interest in video games in my childhood took me into a journey into math and computer science, that included doing a PhD and working at Google.
The talk was presented at [FES Acatlan](https://acatlan.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, as part of the [40th anniversary](https://mac.acatlan.unam.mx/micrositios/40anios/principal.html){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} of the bachelors program in [Applied Mathematics and Computer Science](https://mac.acatlan.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. It was presented on march 1st of 2023

## Interview about Robert E. Howard

{% include youtube.html id='kqdjA88cibk' %}

My wife has her own [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@eleutherialekona), where she has a seccion where she interviews guests. She invited me to talk about one of my personal favorite subjects: life and work of the American writer Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan.

[Beware of science](https://www.facebook.com/aguasconlaciencia){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} is a weekly show on FB about science. They invited me, along with other experts; to [a round table](https://fb.watch/ppsZG28yYs/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} about another of my personal interests: Free Software.
