## Education

### Philosophical Doctorate

![Purdue University]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/purdue2.jpg "Purdue University")

I studied [PhD in Technology](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/phd-technology){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, that is imparted at the [Purdue Polytechnic Institute](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (formerly known as the College of Technology) which is in the main campus at West Lafayette (Indiana, USA).

Each PhD student belongs to a department. I was in the department of [Computer Graphics Technology](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/departments/computer-graphics-technology){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
The curriculum for the PhD requires taking statistics, and methodology of research courses.
In addition, I took courses in Computer Graphics, since it was my area of research and on Computer Science and Mathematics for my optional courses.

During my PhD, my supervisor and mentor was [Dr. Bedrich Benes](https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/bbenes/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
I was part of the HPCG lab (now part of Computer Science ) where I conducted research on Computer Graphics and Additive Manufacturing (a. k. a. 3D printing), that culminated in several [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/).

### Master degree

![IIMAS UNAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/iimas1.jpg "IIMAS UNAM")

I studied a [Master's degree in Computer Science](http://www.mcc.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} at the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (UNAM).
The master program, has several locations, I spent most on my time at the [Institute of Research in Applied Mathematics and Systems](https://www.iimas.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (IIMAS), in the main campus of Ciudad Universitaria (CDMX, Mexico).

After finishing the core courses, each student chooses a research area to focus on. I decided to go to [Signals, Images and Virtual Environments](http://www.mcc.unam.mx/SIAV.php){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, where I took several courses in Digital Image Processing and Computer Graphics.

My thesis supervisor was [Dr. Edgar Garduno Angeles](https://turing.iimas.unam.mx/~egarduno/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, and I did a thesis which lies in the intersection of Digital Image Processing, Scientific Visualization and Computer Graphics.

### Bachelor degree

![FES Acatlan UNAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/acatlan2.jpg "FES Acatlan UNAM")

I did my bachelor's studies at [FES Acatlan](https://www.acatlan.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, which is one the satellite campi of UNAM. I study a rather unique bachelors degree: [Applied Mathematics and Computer Science](https://mac.acatlan.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (or M@ as we like to call it).

At that time after the core courses (six semesters), you went to a pre-speciality path (for the last three semesters).
I took the "Simulation and Decision Making" path, which was studying [Operation Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
Nowadays you could almost call it Data Science (but I just don’t like that term).

I decided to get my degree by doing a thesis. My thesis supervisor was [Dr. Maria del Carmen Villar Patino](https://cadit.anahuac.mx/n/claustro/dra-maria-del-carmen-villar-patino){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and I did a work about Physically Based Simulation and Computer Graphics.

## Experience in the industry

### Google

![Googleplex]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/google1.jpg "Googleplex")

I joined [Google](https://about.google/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} on March of 2021 as a Technical Solutions Engineer in [Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/gg/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
My main job was helping partners bring their content (video games) to the platform.
My focus was computer graphics, so I provided support for DX11, DX12 and Vulkan.
I also contributed with backend and samples to [Big Wheels](https://github.com/google/bigwheels){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, a graphics framework that later became open source.

Stadia was shut down on January of 2023, and after being jumping on several projects I switched to a Software Engineer position and become part of the Platforms and Ecosystems organization, where I contribute to shape Google’s [vision on XR](https://arvr.google.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

### Nvidia

![Nvidia Endeavor]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/nvidia2.jpg "Nvidia Endeavor")

After graduating from my PhD in September of 2017, I joined [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and they helped me to relocate to San Jose California (a.k.a Silicon Valley).

At Nvidia, I was a Software Engineer on the web browsers team, where I did some work on AR, and designed some web components of [ISAAC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-ros){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
Later, they switched me to the 3D graphics driver for the mobile team, where I did some low level work on OpenGL, worked on Safety for Automotive and made my first steps with Vulkan.

### TSC

![WTC Mexico]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/tsc.jpg "WTC Mexico")

After finishing my bachelor's courses in 2008, I joined [Tecnologia en Sistemas de Computo](https://mx.linkedin.com/company/tecnologia-en-sistemas-de-computotsc){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} which is software consulting company in CDMX.

I started woking at TSC _before_ getting my bachelors diploma (a desition I regret until today).
On the bright side, this was my first professional experience.
I started as an intern and then move to a QA role.
I worked on migrating a system from Insterbase and PoweHouse to Java and Oracle.

## Internships

While I was enrolled on the PhD program, I took every opportunity to do internships during the summer terms.

### Adobe

![Adobe SF office]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/adobe.jpg "Adobe SF office")

During the summer of 2016 I did an internship at [Adobe research](https://research.adobe.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} with the Procedural Image lab (now part of the graphics research team).
However, I sat at the [San Francisco office](https://learning.adobe.com/products-resources/contact-us/americas/san-francisco.html){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

My internship was around a software for that simulated sculpting, where I was doing the rendering system.
This was by far the more interesting internship I had. I implemented some classic graphics algorithms (Ambient Occlusion, Shadow mapping and PBR) using a deferred shading pipeline using C++, OpenGL and HLSL.

### Nvidia

![Nvidia HQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/nvidia1.jpg "Nvidia HQ")

My first internship with Nvidia was in 2014 at the [headquarters](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/multimedia/santa-clara-headquarters){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
I worked in the DirectX driver team, where I implemented some video format encoding in the GPU via their own assembly language.
This was my first professional opportunity to work as a Software Engineer in Silicon Valley.

During the summer of 2015 I did a _second_ internship at [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, and again in the graphics driver.
However, this time I was at the OpenGL driver team.
Where I did work to expose some OpenGL extensions in the driver and to fix some bugs in the OpenGL debug extension.

## Experience in the academy

### Purdue University

![Knoy Hall Purdue]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/purdue1.jpg "Knoy Hall Purdue")

While doing my PhD, I had to work, first as a research assistant (RA) and later as a teaching assistant (TA) both at Purdue Polytechnic Institute. As an RA I spend my time working on research at the [HPCG lab](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/facilities/high-performance-computer-graphics-lab){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, which resulted in [my publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/).

As a TA I assisted in teaching Graphics and programming courses for the [CGT major](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/departments/computer-graphics-technology){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
I worked in designing quizzes and grading for courses in web development (both front end and back end) and in Computer Graphics programming, which was always my favorite, because we teached OpenGL and GLSL.

Finally, I was also part of the [Computational Arts Circle](https://boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/cac){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, where I had the chance of colaborating with [Dr Esteban García Bravo](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/profile/garcia0){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} (a.k.a [snebtor](https://snebtor.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}).
Some of these colaborations also culminted in [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/).

### National Autonomous University of Mexico

At UNAM I had the chance of being a teacher assistant at the Science school and lecturer at FES Acatlan and a research assistant at IIMAS and Science school.

#### FES Acatlan

![FES Acatlan UNAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/acatlan1.jpg "FES Acatlan UNAM")

I taught two courses: Computer Graphics, which is my personal favorite and [Graph Theory](https://mac.acatlan.unam.mx/media/temarios/1644/1310.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. I also designed [the syllabus](https://mac.acatlan.unam.mx/media/temarios/1644/1055.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} for the computer graphics course.

At FESA I tried to do my best to help and participate in every possible activity.
Among others I was a technical council member, contributed to design M@'s plan of study and advised freshman students as a mentor.

#### Science School

![Facultad de ciencias UNAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/ciencias1.jpg "Facultad de ciencias UNAM")

During my masters degree, I was a teaching assistant at [Science School](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}  in [two clases](https://archive.fciencias.unam.mx/directorio/63922){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
The first: Advanced Programming was about Object Oriented Programming.
The second: Modern Geometry was about doing geometry using only a ruler and a pair of compasses.
Modern Geometry it's a funny name since it is the way geometry was studied in ancient Greece.

Before that, I also worked as a laboratory assistant as part of one of the Macropojects at UNAM (which was located also at Science school) for a few months in 2006-2007.
There I was in charge of maintaining our SVN repositories and created a website using a LAMP suite.

#### Institute of Research in Applied Mathematics and Systems

![IIMAS UNAM]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/places/iimas2.jpg "IIMAS UNAM")

Right after finishing my masters, the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.iimas.unam.mx/ciencias-de-la-computacion/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} of [IIMAS](https://www.iimas.unam.mx/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} gave me a temporary position as a research assistant for [Dr Maria Elena Martinez Perez](http://www.pcic.unam.mx/~elena/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} where I contributed in a research about segmenting blood vessels from retina images obtained by a fundus camera, which was a very fun and difficult project.


## Computer skills

### Programming languages

Since most of my professional life I have been a software engineer.
I have extensive experience programming. Nowadays I feel more comfortable using C++, including most of the C++11 features and some of the C++20.
Having said that I am a competent developer in similar languages like C#, Java or C (as in the C19 standar).

I also have experience using programming languages with large frameworks behind them, like Python, Matlab, Qt (with C++) and R.

I have spent most of my professional life working in POSIX operating systems and I feel most comfortable on GNU/Linux.
Again, I am a competent developer in a Windows environment too.

As a shader language I have always preferred GLSL (either with OpenGL or Vulkan).
However I do know enough HLSL (with DX11 or DX12) to accomplish most graphics tasks.

### Frameworks and APIs

My focus has been as a graphics programmer and I usually use [GLTF](https://www.glfw.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} as a windows manager and different libraries (recently I have been a huge fan of [Dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}) to do UI for graphics apps.

I also have experience using higher level game engines like Unity and Unreal, but I am not an expert on those (yet!).


Finally, I have moderate experience as a web developer using PHP and ASP.NET MVC, at the backend with some knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS for the front end.

### General software engineering skills

I have experience working with SVN, but right now I am only using either git (my favorite) or P4.
I usually develop using the Android approach, which includes [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. However, I like using Github for my personal projects.

I usually work in small teams that do sprint based development, track their progress SW tools and on regular meetings.
I am used to writing unit tests, doing code reviews and to present my work on meetings.

I am also used to working either from the office or from home. This means that I am able to keep constant communication with my team by chat, VC If any of us is remote.
If we are in the office, I like to chat and go for lunch with my teammates.
